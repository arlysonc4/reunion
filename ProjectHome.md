## What and why? ##

Biosfear also known as Laghaim or Savage Eden, is an mmorpg with a rocky history, with a beta program starting in Q3 2003 it showed a lot of promise, and got many people hooked from the start. There have been commercialized servers in Asia, Europe and the Usa.

This project contains code written for research in an attempt to reverse engineer a biosfear server. It was developed against the beta version of the client. The current state of the project is that it contains basic gameplay mechanics, such as movement, a working inventory, merchant npcs, monster npcs, as well as a text based database of items, npcs and monsters, that has been mined from the client.

## Disclaimer ##

This code is written and maintained for research into protocol discovery, gameplay mechanics, and reverse engineering. The contributors do not want to encourage, nor endorse people to create so called 'private servers'
